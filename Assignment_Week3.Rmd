This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.
## It is assumed that the matrix supplied is always invertible.


## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
                inv <- NULL
                set <- function(y) {
                  x <<- y
                  inv <<- NULL
                }
                get <- function() x
                setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
                getInverse <- function() inv
                list(set = set,
                     get = get,
                     setInverse = setInverse,
                     getInverse = getInverse)
}

## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
                inv <- x$getInverse()
                if (!is.null(inv)) {
                  message("getting cached matrix")
                  return(inv)
                }
                mat <- x$get()
                inv <- solve(mat, ...)
                x$setInverse(inv)
                inv
}
